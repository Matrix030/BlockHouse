**Layman's Terms**: How the buying/selling pressure in one stock affects the price of other stocks. Like how a run on one bank might cause panic at other banks.

**Technical Detail**:
- Uses OFI from multiple stocks simultaneously
- **In your code**: You'll need to:
    1. Calculate OFI for each stock in your dataset
    2. Use these as features to predict returns of other stocks
    3. The paper uses LASSO regression to find which stocks influence which others
- Particularly important for stocks in the same sector or with economic relationships

**Why it matters**: Modern markets are interconnected. Big institutional traders often buy/sell baskets of related stocks, creating cross-impact effects.

## Understanding Cross-Asset OFI

**Why cross-asset matters:**
- Markets are interconnected (Apple affects tech sector, sector affects market)
- Large institutional orders create ripple effects across related assets
- Cross-asset signals can predict price movements before single-asset signals
- Portfolio strategies require understanding these relationships
- 
**What this step accomplished:**
1. **Cross-asset framework** - Set up methodology for analyzing multiple assets
2. **Correlation analysis** - Examined relationships between assets' order flows
3. **Multiple weighting schemes** - Tested equal, correlation, market-cap, and sector weights
4. **Lagged relationships** - Found predictive signals from other assets
5. **Combined approach** - Created final cross-asset OFI feature
6. **Validation** - Ensured results are reasonable and complete

**Key insights about Cross-Asset OFI:**
- Other assets can predict your target asset (lead-lag relationships)
- Correlation-based weighting often works better than equal weighting
- Lagged cross-asset signals can be more predictive than contemporaneous ones
- Cross-asset OFI adds information not captured by single-asset analysis

**Note on the simulation:** Since your dataset only contains AAPL, I demonstrated the methodology with simulated related assets. In practice, you would:

1. Load real data for SPY, QQQ, MSFT, etc.
2. Calculate their individual OFIs using the same methods
3. Apply the cross-asset framework with real correlations
