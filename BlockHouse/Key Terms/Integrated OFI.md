**Layman's Terms**: Instead of having 10 separate measurements, combine them into one smart score using statistical techniques.

**Technical Detail**:
- Takes all 10 OFI levels and uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- PCA finds the most important pattern across all levels
- **In your code**:
    1. Calculate multi-level OFIs
    2. Apply PCA to find the first principal component
    3. Normalize it to create one integrated measure
- According to the paper, this explains 89% of the variance across all levels

**Why it matters**: Reduces noise while capturing the essential information from all levels. Like getting one "crowd sentiment" score instead of 10 different measurements.

Step 4: Calculating Integrated OFI
Now we'll create the Integrated OFI using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to intelligently combine all 10 levels into a single, optimized metric. This is the most sophisticated approach from the research paper.

## Understanding Integrated OFI

**Why use PCA?**
- Multi-level OFI has 10 correlated dimensions
- PCA finds the direction of maximum variance (most important pattern)
- Reduces noise while preserving signal
- Creates a single metric that captures the essence of all levels

**What this step accomplished:**
1. **Analyzed correlation structure** - showed how the 10 OFI levels are related
2. **Applied PCA** - found the principal component that explains most variance
3. **Extracted optimal weights** - used first PC to weight each level optimally
4. **Calculated Integrated OFI** - combined all levels using PCA weights
5. **Compared methods** - showed how PCA approach differs from simple aggregation
6. **Quality analysis** - evaluated the characteristics of our integrated metric
7. **Saved results** - prepared for cross-asset analysis

**Key insights you should see:**
- Strong correlations between levels justify using PCA
- First PC typically explains 80-90% of variance
- Best level (00) usually gets highest weight, but deeper levels contribute too
- Integrated OFI is smoother and more stable than individual levels
- The weights reveal which parts of order book are most informative
