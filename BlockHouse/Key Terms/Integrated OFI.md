**Layman's Terms**: Instead of having 10 separate measurements, combine them into one smart score using statistical techniques.

**Technical Detail**:
- Takes all 10 OFI levels and uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- PCA finds the most important pattern across all levels
- **In your code**:
    1. Calculate multi-level OFIs
    2. Apply PCA to find the first principal component
    3. Normalize it to create one integrated measure
- According to the paper, this explains 89% of the variance across all levels

**Why it matters**: Reduces noise while capturing the essential information from all levels. Like getting one "crowd sentiment" score instead of 10 different measurements.
