## **What This Assignment Is About**

This is a **quantitative finance** internship focused on **market microstructure** - basically studying how financial markets work at a very detailed, minute-by-minute level. Think of it like analyzing the "plumbing" of stock markets.

## **Key Concept: [[Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)]]**

**Simple analogy:**
- If lots of people suddenly want to buy Apple stock but few want to sell, there's a "flow imbalance"
- This imbalance often predicts which way the price will move next
- It's like measuring the "pressure" building up before a price change

## **What You Need to Build**
You need to create 4 different types of OFI calculations:
1. [[Best-Level OFI]]: Only looks at the best bid/ask prices (like looking at the front of the auction line)
2. [[Multi-Level OFI]]: Looks deeper into the [[order book]] (like seeing 10 rows deep in the auction)
3. [[Integrated OFI]]: Combines multiple levels into one smart metric
4. [[Cross-Asset OFI]]: How imbalances in one stock affect other stocks
